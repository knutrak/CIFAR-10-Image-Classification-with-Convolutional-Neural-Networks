# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch.

## Project Overview

The model is trained to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, cat, etc.).  
Using a CNN architecture, the model achieved a **test accuracy of 85%**.
